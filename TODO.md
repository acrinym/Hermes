# TODO / Future Improvements

This file lists potential enhancements for Hermes beyond its current features. These ideas come from brainstorming and user feedback.

## Macro Enhancements
- Macro scheduling to run workflows later or on intervals
- Conditional macros with branching logic or loops
 - ~~Visual macro editor for reordering or editing steps~~ (added in v3.8)
- Shareable macro files or online gallery
- Trigger macros via global hotkeys or toolbar buttons
 - ~~Export macros as JSON for backups or sharing~~ (added in v3.8)

## Form Filling & Heuristics
- AI-powered field recognition
- Built-in mappings for common services (e.g., BMC Helix)
- Sliders to adjust similarity thresholds
- Detect repeated forms to auto-learn fields
- Capture screenshots or context during training

## User Interface & Usability
- ~~Full options page in Chrome settings~~ (implemented in v3.7)
- ~~More themes and import/export support~~ (implemented in v3.7)
- Multi-language localization
- Dark mode that follows system theme
- First-run onboarding or tutorial
- Quick search/filter for macros and profiles

## Synchronization & Portability
- Cloud sync for profiles and macros
- Support for Firefox/Edge versions
- Import data from the userscript version
- One-click backup and restore of all settings

## Debugging & Developer Tooling
- Expanded debug overlay with playback logs
- Network request capture and replay in macros
- Integration with browser DevTools for DOM inspection
- Automated test suite and CI workflow
- Modularize the codebase (consider TypeScript)

## Advanced Automation
- Wait-for-element and wait-for-network-idle steps
- Macro watch mode for DOM mutations
- REST API integration during form filling
- Notifications when macros or fills complete
- Capture and restore scroll positions

## Security & Privacy
- Optional encryption for stored data
- Clear prompts when recording sensitive info
- Granular permissions to limit domain access
