# Hermes Roadmap

This roadmap outlines upcoming milestones for consolidating the userscript and extension features.

## Short Term
- Integrate remaining Tampermonkey tools directly into the extension:
  - Task list panel
  - Pomodoro timer panel
- Maintain existing theming and TypeScript structure

## Mid Term
- Polish UX around the new panels
- Merge any other useful helpers from the userscripts

## Long Term
- Marketplace for shared macros and profiles *(deferred)*
- Cloud storage with OAuth for Drive, OneDrive and Box *(deferred)*

These later items require additional API keys and capital to implement. They remain in the plan but will be revisited after the core features stabilize.
