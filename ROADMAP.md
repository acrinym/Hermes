# Hermes Development Roadmap

This roadmap highlights near-term priorities and deferred ideas.

## In Progress
- Integrate remaining features from the original userscript into the extension for a unified experience.
- Add quality-of-life panels such as a task list for quick to-dos.

## Planned
- Macro marketplace for sharing workflows (future milestone).
- Cloud storage integration using OAuth for Drive, OneDrive and Box (deferred until licensing concerns are resolved).
- Continued refinements to the theming system and localization.

The sequence may change as resources allow.
