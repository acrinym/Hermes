# Hermes Development Roadmap

This roadmap highlights near-term priorities and deferred ideas.

The sequence may change as resources allow.

## In Progress
- Integrate remaining features from the original userscript into the extension for a unified experience.
- Add quality-of-life panels such as a task list for quick to-dos.

This roadmap outlines upcoming milestones for consolidating the userscript and extension features.

## Short Term
- Integrate remaining Tampermonkey tools directly into the extension:
  - Task list panel
  - Pomodoro timer panel
- Maintain existing theming and TypeScript structure

## Mid Term
- Polish UX around the new panels
- Merge any other useful helpers from the userscripts

## Long Term
- Marketplace for shared macros and profiles *(deferred)*
- Cloud storage with OAuth for Drive, OneDrive and Box *(deferred)*
- Continued refinements to the theming system and localization.

These later items require additional API keys and capital to implement. They remain in the plan but will be revisited after the core features stabilize.
